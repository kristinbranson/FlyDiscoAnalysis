The code in these subdirectories:

APT
FlyTracker
JAABA
tmt
tpt

used to be individual submodules.

Then we decided to stop using submodules for various reasons, so we
just made copies of the code in these repos that we now maintain
within the FlyDiscoAnalysis repo.  This happened on 2025-07-10.

Those commits are commits in the respective "ancestral" GitHub repo:

APT:         https://github.com/kristinbranson/APT
FlyTracker:  https://github.com/kristinbranson/FlyTracker
JAABA:       https://github.com/kristinbranson/JAABA
tmt:         https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/tmt
tpt:         https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/tpt

The plan is to sync up with the ancestral repos from time to time, and
when you do that it's useful to know the commit that was sync'ed up
with the last time this was done:

These are the commits used at last sync:

APT:         82a719dfcbdacc07854cc56e1043e7508c9868d3
FlyTracker:  d0e4602c12f9f2cf47140ad73bdea01a4da0b824
JAABA:       088a593a04747409cff9eb41ceae4773847168a6
tmt:         07cfdec91babcd92c0e21a8997708bfc6fe99236
tpt:         7179febc99a591f386eeba79239078dd533e7c3a

When you do a re-sync with one of these repos, please update this
file.
