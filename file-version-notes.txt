    Changes so we set up the path once, then leave it alone

-- 

The versions of these files provided by JAABA and FlyTracker are identical:

ufmf_read_frame.m 
ufmf_read_mean.m 
angledist.m
argmax.m
argmin.m
dtypechar2matlabclass.m
modrange.m
myparse.m (FlyTracker provides twice also, both identical)
myparse_nocheck.m

--

JAABA provides two versions of uigetdir2.m (JAABA/filehandling/uigetdir2.m and JAABA/misc/uigetdir2.m),
not clear which one is 'right'.

--

JAABA provides two version of SelectHistEdges.m, but they are identical.

--

JAABA provides JAABA/misc/findjobj.m and JAABA/perframe/findjobj.m.  The perframe one is a more recent version,
but don't want to touch JAABA, so leaving alone.

--

JAABA provides JAABA/misc/myfileparts.m and JAABA/perframe/myfileparts.m, which are different. 
Don't want to touch JAABA, so leaving alone.

--

JAABA provides JAABA/spaceTime/pdollarOF/checkNumArgs.m and JAABA/spaceTime/toolbox/matlab/checkNumArgs.m,
which differ only in the comments.

--

JAABA provides JAABA/spaceTime/pdollarOF/convnFast.m and JAABA/spaceTime/toolbox/images/convnFast.m, 
which differ somewhat.  Left alone.

--

JAABA/spaceTime/pdollarOF/filterGauss.m and JAABA/spaceTime/toolbox/filters/filterGauss.m differ only in the comments.

--

JAABA/spaceTime/pdollarOF/gaussSmooth.m and JAABA/spaceTime/toolbox/images/gaussSmooth.m differ slightly.
Left alone.

--

JAABA/spaceTime/pdollarOF/im.m and JAABA/spaceTime/toolbox/images/im.m differ somewhat.
Left alone.

--

JAABA/spaceTime/pdollarOF/localSum.m and JAABA/spaceTime/toolbox/images/localSum.m differ somewhat.
Left alone.

--

FlyDiscoAnalysis and JAABA provide different versions of these, but we want to use the FlyDiscoAnalysis versions:

ReadParams.m
fif.m
SetUpJAABAPath.m
ufmf_read_header.m

--

JAABA and FlyTracker both provide a version of ufmf_read_header.m.  The JAABA version returns one extra field in the returned
header struct.  But we override this function anyway, so we don't care.
